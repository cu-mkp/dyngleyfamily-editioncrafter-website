# About

Early modern English people were avid collectors of medieval manuscripts filled with centuries-old texts related to medicine, astrology, agriculture, or craft manufacture. This project seeks to understand why early modern readers valued this medieval knowledge, how generations of readers engaged with these manuscripts over time, and what role these older books played in the development of the new science through the manuscript collection of Henry Dyngley (ca. 1515â€“1598). The first stage of this project, begun in summer 2023, focuses on Trinity College Cambridge MS O.8.35. To read more about this manuscript, Henry Dyngley, and manuscript collecting in sixteenth-century England, visit the [Introduction]({{<ref "introduction" >}}) page.

The user interface for this website is run through GitHub Pages using the repository [dyngleyfamily-editioncrafter-website](https://github.com/cu-mkp/dyngleyfamily-editioncrafter-website). This repository contains the basic content for the site: the Introduction, About, Credit, and Resources pages. The data and metadata generated from the manuscript transcriptions and annotations are held in a separate GitHub repository [dyngleyfamily-editioncrafter-data](https://github.com/cu-mkp/dyngleyfamily-editioncrafter-data/tree/main). The two repositories are linked to one another with EditionCrafter, a publication tool for digital critical editions under development by the [Making and Knowing Project](https://makingandknowing.org/) (M&K), [Performant Software Solutions](https://www.performantsoftware.com/), and a number of case-study collaborators. 

EditionCrafter, under development (2022-2024), is designed to be an open-source, customizable publishing tool that will allow users to deploy their own texts, data, and commentary as low-maintenance digital critical editions. It will enable the creation of static sites that rely on basic well-established technologies and workflows to address issues of longevity, maintenance, sustainability, and cost. For more about this work, see the NSF award announcement: [Crafting an Open Source Digital Publication Tool for the History of Science](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2218218&HistoricalAwards=false).

This project builds upon the publication of *[Secrets of Craft and Nature. A Digital Critical Edition of BnF Ms. Fr. 640](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/)* by the Making and Knowing Project. The underlying software developed for *Secrets of Craft and Nature* will serve as the starting point for EditionCrafter.
