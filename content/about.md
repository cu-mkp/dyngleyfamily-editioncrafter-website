# About

As of May 2024, this website features preliminary transcriptions of the first few folios of Trinity 
College Cambridge MS O.8.35, a mid-fifteenth century Middle English medical manuscript that was owned by Henry Dyngley (ca. 1515â€“1589). 
These transcriptions were prepared from a digital facsimile created by the librarians at Trinity College. Transcriptions and high-res images of the manuscript are viewable on the [folios]({{<ref "folios" >}}) pages.
To read about Henry Dyngley and this manuscript as part of his collection, visit the [Introduction]({{<ref "introduction" >}}) page.


The preliminary transcriptions of TCC MS O.8.35 were completed by Melissa Reynolds in the summer of 2023 
as one of several trial projects associated with the development of EditionCrafter, under development (2022-2024), a publication tool for digital critical editions under development by the 
[Making and Knowing Project](https://makingandknowing.org/) (M&K), [Performant Software Solutions](https://www.performantsoftware.com/), 
and a number of case-study collaborators. EditionCrafter is designed to be an open-source, customizable 
publishing tool that will allow users to deploy their own texts, data, and commentary as 
low-maintenance digital critical editions. It will enable the creation of static sites that 
rely on basic well-established technologies and workflows to address issues of longevity, 
maintenance, sustainability, and cost. For more about this work, see the NSF award 
announcement: [Crafting an Open Source Digital Publication Tool for the History of Science](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2218218&HistoricalAwards=false).  


The data and metadata generated from the manuscript transcriptions and annotations available on this site 
are available in the GitHub repository [dyngleyfamily-editioncrafter-data](https://github.com/cu-mkp/dyngleyfamily-editioncrafter-data/tree/main). 
This website runs in a Hugo environment on GitHub Pages from the repository [dyngleyfamily-editioncrafter-website](https://github.com/cu-mkp/dyngleyfamily-editioncrafter-website), based 
on a template created for the publication of *[Secrets of Craft and Nature. A Digital Critical Edition of BnF Ms. Fr. 640](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/)* 
by the Making and Knowing Project.
