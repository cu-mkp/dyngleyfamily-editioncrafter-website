# About

Early modern English people were avid collectors of medieval manuscripts filled with centuries-old texts related to medicine, astrology, agriculture, or craft manufacture. This project seeks to understand why early modern readers valued this medieval knowledge, how generations of readers engaged with these manuscripts over time, and what role these older books played in the development of the new science through the manuscript collection of Henry Dyngley (ca. 1515â€“1598). Dyngley's collecting habits were first noticed by the late Lister Matheson, whose notes on Dyngley's annotations in two manuscripts and one printed book held in the Welcome Collection. Since 2013, the project's lead researcher, Melissa Reynolds, has identified Dyngley's marginalia in another four fiftenth-century manuscripts, bringing the handlist of Dyngley's library to a total of seven items:

* [Wellcome Library MS 5262](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/nuckbt25/items), a late fourteenth-century collection of Middle English medical recipes, possibly created at Winchcombe Abbey in Gloucestershire
* [Bodleian Library MS Rawlinson C.506](https://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/manuscript_8244), a mid-fifteenth century manuscript composed of several, originally-separate manuscripts related to medicine, agriculture, and husbandry, which were joined together by a later medieval or early modern reader
* British Library MS Royal 17 A.xxxii, a manuscript from the first half of the fifteenth century containing Middle English texts on prognostication, an herbal, and a collection of medical receipts
* [Trinity College Cambridge Library MS O.8.35](https://mss-cat.trin.cam.ac.uk/Manuscript/O.8.35), a later fifteenth-century Middle English all-purpose medical guidebook, identical in format and contents to Bodleian Library MS Add. B.60
* [Trinity College Cambridge MS R.14.52](https://mss-cat.trin.cam.ac.uk/Manuscript/R.14.52), a mid-fifteenth century manuscript featuring several translations of learned, Latinate medical texts in Middle English
* [Welcome Library MS 244](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/zztf5pre), a later sixteenth- and seventeenth-century manuscript of medical, meteorological, and alchemical knowledge, begun by Henry Dyngley and completed by his descendants
* [Wellcome EPB/A/7330, _A newe book Entituled the Gouvernement of Healthe_, William Bulleyn](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/bga5qyg2), a medical manual and dietary published in London in 1558

The first stage of this project, begun in summer 2023, focuses on Trinity College Cambridge MS O.8.35. To read more about this manuscript, Henry Dyngley, and manuscript collecting in sixteenth-century England, visit the Introductions page.
