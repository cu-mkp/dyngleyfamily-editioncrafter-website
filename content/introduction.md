# Introduction

## Collecting Medical Knowledge Across Generations

Historians of science agree that something pivotal happened in England in the latter decades of the sixteenth century, as medieval theories about the body or the natural world diminished in the face of new discoveries, new ideas, and a new experimental method. And yet, the reading habits of sixteenth-century English artisans, bureaucrats, merchants, and farmers tell a different story, one that this project seeks to explore. Early modern English people were avid collectors of medieval manuscripts filled with centuries-old texts related to medicine, astrology, agriculture, or craft manufacture. _Old Books, New Attitudes_ seeks to understand why early modern readers valued this medieval knowledge; how generations of readers engaged with these manuscripts over time; and what role these older books played in the development of the new medical sciences. 

The first stage of the project focuses on Trinity College Cambridge MS O.8.35, a later fifteenth-century guide to medical practice and one of at least five Middle English “how-to” manuscripts owned by Henry Dyngley (ca. 1515-1589). EditionCrafter provides the ready-made infrastructure for a digital critical edition of TCC MS O.8.35 that encodes both the medieval origins, materials, and methods of the recipes and instructions original to the manuscript, as well as reader marks and signatures that demonstrate the use and reuse of the manuscript over time. If the prototype edition of TCC MS O.8.35 is a success, _Old Books, New Attitudes_ will produce digital editions of Dyngley’s other medieval manuscripts with the goal of reconstructing Dyngley’s library, and by extension, the sources he mined as author of Wellcome MS 244, a huge compendium of medical, alchemical, and meteorological knowledge. 

The aim of the project is to reconstruct the intergenerational transference of medical and scientific knowledge in books, and to show how medieval sources played an important role in facilitating a culture of scientific exchange and inquiry in early modern England.

## Why Henry Dyngley?

Dyngley was born around 1515, probably near his family's manor home of Charlton in the parish of Cropthorne, Worcestershire. The Dyngley family had been in possession of that estate since the late fourteenth century, but in 1541, Henry inherited it from his father, John. 

## About Trinity College Cambridge MS O.8.35

This open-access critical edition is only possible thanks to the digitization efforts of the librarians at Trinity College. TCC MS O.8.35 has been digitized in IIIF format; the link to the IIIF manifest is here: [https://mss-cat.trin.cam.ac.uk/Manuscript/O.8.35/manifest.json](https://mss-cat.trin.cam.ac.uk/Manuscript/O.8.35/manifest.json). Additional information on the manuscript's contents, format, and provenance is available in the Wren Library's [James Catalogue Online](https://mss-cat.trin.cam.ac.uk/Manuscript/O.8.35).

## Developing the Critical Edition with EditionCrafter

The user interface for this website is run through GitHub Pages using the repository [dyngleyfamily-editioncrafter-website]. This repository contains the basic content for the site: the Introduction, About, Credit, and Resources pages. The data and metadata generated from the manuscript transcriptions and annotations are held in a separate GitHub repository [dyngleyfamily-editioncrafter-data](https://github.com/cu-mkp/dyngleyfamily-editioncrafter-data/tree/main). The two repositories are linked to one another with EditionCrafter, a publication tool for digital critical editions under development by the [Making and Knowing Project](https://makingandknowing.org/) (M&K), [Performant Software Solutions](https://www.performantsoftware.com/), and a number of case-study collaborators. 

EditionCrafter, under development (2022-2024), is designed to be an open-source, customizable publishing tool that will allow users to deploy their own texts, data, and commentary as low-maintenance digital critical editions. It will enable the creation of static sites that rely on basic well-established technologies and workflows to address issues of longevity, maintenance, sustainability, and cost. For more about this work, see the NSF award announcement: [Crafting an Open Source Digital Publication Tool for the History of Science](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2218218&HistoricalAwards=false).

This project builds upon the publication of *[Secrets of Craft and Nature. A Digital Critical Edition of BnF Ms. Fr. 640](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/)* by the Making and Knowing Project. The underlying software developed for *Secrets of Craft and Nature* will serve as the starting point for EditionCrafter.
