## Collecting Medical Knowledge Across Generations

Historians of science agree that something pivotal happened in England in the latter 
decades of the sixteenth century, as medieval theories about the body or the natural 
world diminished in the face of new discoveries, new ideas, and a new experimental method. 
And yet, the reading habits of sixteenth-century English artisans, bureaucrats, merchants, 
and farmers tell a different story, one that this project seeks to explore. Early modern 
English people were avid collectors of medieval manuscripts filled with centuries-old texts 
related to medicine, astrology, agriculture, or craft manufacture. _Old Books, New Attitudes_ 
seeks to understand why early modern readers valued this medieval knowledge; how generations 
of readers engaged with these manuscripts over time; and what role these older books played 
in the development of the new medical sciences. 

The first stage of the project focuses on Trinity College Cambridge MS O.8.35, a later 
fifteenth-century guide to medical practice and one of at least five Middle English medical 
manuscripts owned by Henry Dyngley (ca. 1515-1589). EditionCrafter provides the ready-made 
infrastructure for a digital critical edition of TCC MS O.8.35 that encodes both the medieval 
origins, materials, and methods of the recipes and instructions original to the manuscript, 
as well as reader marks and signatures that demonstrate the use and reuse of the manuscript 
over time. If the prototype edition of TCC MS O.8.35 is a success, _Old Books, New Attitudes_ 
will incorporate student researchers and produce digital editions of Dyngley’s other 
medieval manuscripts with the goal of reconstructing Dyngley’s library, and by extension, 
the sources he mined as author of Wellcome MS 244, a huge compendium of medical, alchemical, 
and meteorological knowledge. 

The aim of the project is to reconstruct the intergenerational transference of medical and 
scientific knowledge in books, and to show how medieval sources played an important role 
in facilitating a culture of scientific exchange and inquiry in early modern England.

## Henry Dyngley's Collecting Habits

Henry Dyngley's collecting habits were first noticed by the late Lister Matheson, Professor 
of English and Medieval Studies at Michigan State University, whose initial notes on Dyngley's 
annotations in two manuscripts and one printed book held in the Welcome Collection were shared 
with this project's lead researcher, Melissa Reynolds. Since 2013, Reynolds has identified 
Dyngley's marginalia in another four fiftenth-century manuscripts, bringing the handlist of 
Dyngley's library to a total of seven items:

* [Wellcome Library MS 5262](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/nuckbt25/items), a late fourteenth-century collection of Middle English medical recipes, possibly created at Winchcombe Abbey in Gloucestershire
* [Bodleian Library MS Rawlinson C.506](https://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/manuscript_8244), a mid-fifteenth century manuscript composed of several, originally-separate manuscripts related to medicine, agriculture, and husbandry, which were joined together by a later medieval or early modern reader
* British Library MS Royal 17 A.xxxii, a manuscript from the first half of the fifteenth century containing Middle English texts on prognostication, an herbal, and a collection of medical receipts
* [Trinity College Cambridge Library MS O.8.35](https://mss-cat.trin.cam.ac.uk/Manuscript/O.8.35), a later fifteenth-century Middle English all-purpose medical guidebook, identical in format and contents to Bodleian Library MS Add. B.60
* [Trinity College Cambridge MS R.14.52](https://mss-cat.trin.cam.ac.uk/Manuscript/R.14.52), a mid-fifteenth century manuscript featuring several translations of learned, Latinate medical texts in Middle English
* [Welcome Library MS 244](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/zztf5pre), a later sixteenth- and seventeenth-century manuscript of medical, meteorological, and alchemical knowledge, begun by Henry Dyngley and completed by his descendants
* [Wellcome EPB/A/7330, _A newe book Entituled the Gouvernement of Healthe_, by William Bulleyn](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/bga5qyg2), a medical manual and dietary published in London in 1558

Henry Dyngley was born around 1515, probably near his family's manor home of Charlton in 
the parish of Cropthorne, Worcestershire. The Dyngley family had been in possession of that 
estate since the late fourteenth century, but in 1541, Henry inherited it from his father, John. 


Very little is known of Henry or his manuscript collecting habits prior to the 1540s. It seems 
he did not attend university, nor had he yet attained much in the way of political or social stature. 
But, in the same decade in which he became lord of the manor of Charlton, Dyngley appeares to have 
developed an interest in medieval manuscripts, perhaps thanks to the dissolution of 
Winchcombe Abbey in 1539, when Dyngley was just twenty-four. Winchcombe was only about twenty miles
from Dyngley's manor at Charlton, and it was also very likely the locus of origin for Wellcome MS 5262. 
The manuscript is a beautiful, late fourteenth-century collection of medical recipes, into 
which Henry inscribed his name and initials. With three full-page illustrations of saints 
on its opening folios, decorated initials, and rows of neat Gothic script, Wellcome MS 5262 
looks a good deal like the sort of manuscript that might have originated in a monastic scriptorium. 
Indeed, the final folio of Wellcome MS 5262 features a prayer, added by a later fifteenth-century reader, 
to St. Kenelm, patron saint of Winchcombe Abbey in Gloucestershire.

Though Dyngley left no dated reader mark in Wellcome MS 5262, someone who possessed the 
manuscript after the dissolution and the upheaval of the English Reformation took care to 
partially obscure the illustrations of saints on the manuscript’s opening pages using the 
same technique found in another of Dyngley's manuscripts, Bodleian MS Rawlinson C.506, 
which we can securely place in his hands before 1547.  


Bodleian MS Rawlinson C.506, a thick manuscript of over 300 small paper pages, crammed with 
recipes, charms, verses on bloodletting, equine medicine, and treatises on planting, grafting, 
fishing, and hawking may also have come to Dyngley as a spoil of the dissolution. Before Dyngley 
owned the manuscript, it passed through the hands of “humfridus harrison Capellanus” (Humfrey 
Harrison, chaplain), who left a reader mark on the manuscript’s final page. He may well be 
the same Humfrey Harrison who was vicar of Alstonefield in Staffordshire in the later 
fifteenth century.  Alstonefield was owned by the Cistercian abbey of Combermere, which means
that the vicar's belongings might have passed into the Crown's possession upon the abbey’s 
surrender on 27 July 1538. For the next decade the whereabouts of the manuscript are 
unknown, but somehow by 1547 it was in the hands of Henry Dyngley, who added a new recipe 
“for migraines” to its pages, which he signed “by me henry Dyngley of Charleton in the 
parish of Cropthorne written by me the .14. day of august anno domini 1547 I being of the age 32.”

  
Over the next two decades Dyngley amassed another three fifteenth-century medical manuscripts 
as his fortunes and family increased. By 1550, Dyngley had married Mary Neville, daughter 
of Sir Edward Neville, a courtier close to Henry VIII. By 1553, when he was appointed 
Sheriff of Worcestershire for the first time, he was also the proud father of three sons: 
Francis, the eldest, followed by George and Henry. And by 1554, Henry had managed to procure 
yet another medical manuscript, Trinity College Cambridge MS O.8.35, a professionally-produced 
vernacular medical textbook, with recipes and treatises on uroscopy, on the four humors, 
on anatomy, and on “simples.” Just as in his other manuscripts, Dyngley used blank space 
in the Trinity College manuscript to add extra recipes. In 1557, he copied a list of 
“waters” onto the last page of the book, which he again signed and dated, “Henry Dyngley 
anno Christo 1557 xxx may at Adyngton in Buckinghamshire.”  


Queen Mary’s death in 1557 perhaps heralded a return to stability for Dyngley, as England 
reverted back to Protestantism from the five-year Catholic interlude of Mary’s reign—though 
Dyngley appears to have remained in the Crown’s good graces under both Mary and Elizabeth. 
Around 1560, Dyngley began consolidating his landholdings in Cropthorne, bringing suit 
against the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral at Worcester for rights to common lands 
pertaining to his manor at Charlton.  That same year, he acquired both a new daughter, 
Mary, and another medical manuscript, British Library MS Royal 17 A.xxxii, which he again 
signed and dated over several folios.  The following two years brought another two daughters 
in quick succession, Barbara and Alice, the last of Henry’s nine children.  


Perhaps it was the births of Mary, Barbara, and Alice in Dyngley’s late forties that 
inspired him, sometime after 1563, to fill blank leaves toward the end of the Royal manuscript 
with a series of verses which he titled, “A godly exhortation for a father to his children.” 
The poem, excerpted from John Foxe’s Acts and Monuments and attributed to the Marian martyr 
Robert Smith, was originally written as a macabre invocation for Smith’s children to remember 
their father “in prison and in payne” and to reflect on their own mortality.  In Dyngley’s 
hands, the poem took on a different tone. It is still a reflection on a father’s mortality 
and the ephemeral nature of familial bonds, but where the printed version in the Acts and 
Monuments ends with an extended reflection on the horrors of Catholicism and an admonition 
to reject that errant “whore of Rome,” Dyngley chose not to include those verses in his copy. 
Instead, Dyngley closed his poem thus: “I leave you here a little book to loke upon / 
to see your fathers face when he is dead and gone.”  

If this verse can be read as a reflection of Dyngley’s intentions, then his collecting 
habits were more than a hobby. In the manuscripts he collected and annotated with his initials, 
he was constructing an archive of natural knowledge for his children. In 1564, just one 
year after “A father’s exhortation for his children” appeared in the first English edition 
of Foxe’s Acts and Monuments, Dyngley began work on his own “little book” to leave for his 
children when he was dead and gone: Wellcome MS 244, a manuscript that reorganized the 
knowledge he had collected from old manuscripts into a valuable reference for those who would 
follow him.


The manuscript Dyngley composed in 1564 opens with a kalendarium. Written in Dyngley’s own 
hand, the calendar is devoid of most of the saints’ days that filled medieval examples of 
the genre, but it features additions of astrological information for every month of the year. 
At the very back of the manuscript, Dyngley wrote notes about the weather that year (“The 
year of our lord god 1564 was the coldest spring & the windiest that ever I did see & it 
was the goodliest year of blooming of all manner of fruit trees”), followed immediately by 
a copy of a prognostication that would help him forecast future weather events. The 
prognostication was a version of the “Book of Thunders,” one of the prognostications discussed 
at length in Chapter 2, predicting weather and crop yields according to whether one hears 
thunder in a given month. He closed this section with a disclaimer to the reader about the 
value of the recipes he’d collected for his manuscript: “Where so ever you see this 
character HD stand in the margin of this my book, against any medicine, oil, ointment, 
salve, plaster, trete, powder, syrup, electuary, unguent, water, or any other thing 
contained within this boke, that have I, Henry Dineley proved without doubt & none other 
have I myself proved.”

In 1573, a decade after he began composing his own recipe collection with this disclaimer 
about the value of recipes marked with an HD, at nearly sixty years old, Dyngley was still 
marking up old manuscripts. Alongside a vernacular treatise on reproduction in Trinity 
College Cambridge MS R.14.52, Dyngley wrote, “Note H D 1573.” At the back of the same 
massive (and beautiful) manuscript, he also updated a running list of the dates of Easter 
with a comment that in 1573 “easter was the xxii day of march.”  It is the latest date that 
appears in any of his manuscripts. Sixteen years later, in 1589, Henry Dyngley died at the 
age of seventy-four. 


## About Trinity College Cambridge MS O.8.35

Trinity College Cambridge MS O.8.35 (hereafter TCC MS O.8.35) has the second oldest dated reader mark of the manuscripts
we can securely place in his collection. It was created sometime in the mid-fifteenth century along with
its companion, Bodleian Library MS Add. B.60. The material composition and format of TCC MS
O.8.45 suggests that it was copied by a professional scribe, as its pages are
