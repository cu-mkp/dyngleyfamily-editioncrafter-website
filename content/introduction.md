# Introduction

Welcome to the digital library of a sixteenth-century English collector: Henry Dyngley (ca. 1515â€“1598). With collaboration from student editors, researchers, and annotators, this site will eventually house digital editions of all six of Dyngley's family's manuscripts, including five fifteenth-century Middle English medical manuscripts, and one sixteenth- and seventeenth-century medical and alchemical manuscript composed by Dyngley and his son and grandson. Using text encoding to trace Dyngley's interactions with these manuscripts and their connections to one another, this project seeks to reconstruct the library of a family whose interest in obtaining and assessing knowledge about the body and the natural world played out in the pages of books over several generations. 

## Why Henry Dyngley?

Dyngley was born around 1515, probably near his family's manor home of Charlton in the parish of Cropthorne, Worcestershire. The Dyngley family had been in possession of that estate since the late fourteenth century, but in 1541, Henry inherited it from his father, John.
